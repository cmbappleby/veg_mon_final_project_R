# Overview

### Row summary {height='35%'}

::: {.card title="NPS Inventory & Monitoring"}
The [National Park Service Inventory & Monitoring Division (IMD)](https://www.nps.gov/im/index.htm) 
consists of 32 networks that gather and analyze inventory and monitoring data, 
and communicate key information on park resources. The monitoring data helps 
park managers understand how the natural resources are changing over time, 
enabling them to make science-based management decisions.

### Row ncpn {height='65%'}

::: {.card title="Northern Colorado Plateau Network Uplands"}
The Northern Colorado Plateau Network (NCPN) conducts monitoring 
for 16 different park units. Upland Vegetation and Soils is considered a high 
monitoring priority since most of land on the Colorado Plateau is upland 
ecosystems. Upland areas include rock outcrops, shrublands, grasslands, 
woodlands, forests, badlands, and subalpine meadows. Plant communities, exotic 
invasive species, biological soil crusts, soil stability, and hydrologic 
function are monitored in uplands ecosystems.

Understanding how vegetation cover changes over time helps park managers to 
detect shifts in plant communities, identify at-risk areas, and make informed 
management decisions. This analysis quantifies vegetation cover trends at Arches
National Park as an example of how upland vegetation monitoring can 
provide information for resource management and conservation efforts.

### arches

::: {.card title='Arches National Park'}
Arches National Park is located north of Moab in Southeast Utah and is part of 
NCPN. Elevation in the park ranges from about 4,000 feet in the canyons to 
5,200 feet on the rims. With an arid climate, the summers are hot and dry, and 
the winters are cool to cold. Average annual precipitation is about 8 inches, 
and temperatures can reach extremes, from -16F to 112F. Most of the park is 
covered by exposed bedrock, weakly developed soils, and sand dunes. The most 
common vegetation type in the park is desert shurblands, but woodlands and 
sparse woodlands are also common.

# Sampling Design & Methods

## Column methods {width='50%'}

::: {.card title='Sampling Design & Field Methods'}
Uplands monitoring began in Arches National Park in 2010 to address the 
management issue of social trailing, and approximately 2,500 hectares are 
monitored. The sampling unit is a plot and consists of three parallel, 50-meter 
transects that are spaced 25 meters apart. To increase the overall sample size, 
a rotating panel design is used where plots are sampled 1-2 years in a row with 
3-6 years of rest.

The point-intercept method is used for estimating vegetation and soil surface 
cover for grassland/shrubland vegetation types. Vegetation and ground 
cover attributes are recorded at 0.5-meter intervals. A laser is used at each 
point, and any vegetation, dead or alive, that the laser intercepts is recorded.
Additionally, vegetation at any height is recorded.

The [Upland Vegetation and Soils Monitoring Protocol](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/593449), 
provides in-depth details about the sampling design.

I downloaded the point-intercept CSV, read it into R, filtered for only records 
from Arches National Park, and only live vegetation records. Before calculating 
percent cover, I removed any duplicate species records for a transect point.
