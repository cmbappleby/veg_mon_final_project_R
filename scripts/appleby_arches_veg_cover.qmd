### Row summary {height='35%'}

::: {.card title="NPS Inventory & Monitoring"}
The [National Park Service Inventory & Monitoring Division (IMD)](https://www.nps.gov/im/index.htm) 
consists of 32 networks that gather and analyze inventory and monitoring data, 
and communicate key information on park resources. The monitoring data helps 
park managers understand how the natural resources are changing over time, 
enabling them to make science-based management decisions.

#### NCPN Uplands Vegetation & Soils Monitoring
The Northern Colorado Plateau Network (NCPN) conducts monitoring 
for 16 different park units. Upland Vegetation and Soils is considered a high 
monitoring priority since most of land on the Colorado Plateau is upland 
ecosystems. Upland areas include rock outcrops, shrublands, grasslands, 
woodlands, forests, badlands, and subalpine meadows. Plant communities, exotic 
invasive species, biological soil crusts, soil stability, and hydrologic 
function are monitored in uplands ecosystems.

Understanding how vegetation cover changes over time helps park managers to 
detect shifts in plant communities, identify at-risk areas, and make informed 
management decisions. This analysis quantifies vegetation cover trends at Arches
National Park as an example of how upland vegetation monitoring can 
provide information for resource management and conservation efforts.

#### Arches NP
Arches National Park is located north of Moab in Southeast Utah and is part of 
NCPN. Elevation in the park ranges from about 4,000 feet in the canyons to 
5,200 feet on the rims. With an arid climate, the summers are hot and dry, and 
the winters are cool to cold. Average annual precipitation is about 8 inches, 
and temperatures can reach extremes, from -16F to 112F. Most of the park is 
covered by exposed bedrock, weakly developed soils, and sand dunes. The most 
common vegetation type in the park is desert shurblands, but woodlands and 
sparse woodlands are also common.

# Sampling

## Column methods {width='50%'}

::: {.card title='Sampling Design & Field Methods'}
Uplands monitoring began in Arches National Park in 2010 to address the 
management issue of social trailing, and approximately 2,500 hectares are 
monitored. The sampling unit is a plot and consists of three parallel, 50-meter 
transects that are spaced 25 meters apart. To increase the overall sample size, 
a rotating panel design is used where plots are sampled 1-2 years in a row with 
3-6 years of rest.

The point-intercept method is used for estimating vegetation and soil surface 
cover for grassland/shrubland vegetation types. Vegetation and ground 
cover attributes are recorded at 0.5-meter intervals. A laser is used at each 
point, and any vegetation, dead or alive, that the laser intercepts is recorded.
Additionally, vegetation at any height is recorded.

The [Upland Vegetation and Soils Monitoring Protocol](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/593449), 
provides in-depth details about the sampling design.

::: {.card title='Analysis'}
I downloaded the [NCPN point-intercept CSV](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2305079), read it into R, 
filtered for only Arches National Park and live vegetation 
records, then calculated percent cover by species to the plot level.

Since there are 84 plots, I wanted to explore the data to find a 
meaningful but efficient way to show vegetation cover changes over time or
identify particular plots to focus on. First, I calculated percent change for 
each species using min and max values, regardless of year. Next, I calculated 
percent change for each species from the first to last survey year. For both, I
reviewed species with 10 percent change or greater and identified select 
plots and species to focus on (see tables to the right).

To visualize the vegetation cover change, I converted cover from percentage to 
area, summed the cover area by species and year, and then calculated the percent
area (species cover area / total area sampled * 100).

The plot-level charts focus on species with large changes in cover over time 
that I selected based on their frequency in the Species Change and Species 
Trend tables. The park-level charts show changes in vegetation cover by area 
across all plots. The species list contains select data from the species lookup 
table for the species shown in the charts.

# Discussion

## Column {width='50%'}
::: {.card title = 'Change in Vegetation Cover'}
Without knowledge of management actions or other events at the park, and with no
location data, I can only speculate as to why vegetation cover changed over 
time at the selected plots. 

Between 2015 and 2022, the cover of an invasive 
annual grass (ERTR13) increased by over 15 percent. At Plot 91, between
2015 and 2022, the cover of an invasive annual grass (BRTE) increased by over 
20 percent. This could be due to some type of disturbance, and I initially 
thought fire because of the low vegetation cover at Plot 91 in 2021, but I did 
not find any reports of fires in the park in 2020 or 2021.

The cover of an invasive annual (SATR12), increases in 2022 at Plot 101, and 
then was not even recorded in 2023. This could be due to an invasive species 
treatment.

Although I cannot explain why the changes in vegetation cover occurred, this 
analysis demonstrates how vegetation cover data are helpful for park managers 
to detect shifts in plant communities. For example, we can see an increase in 
invasive annual grasses, which could prompt park managers to implement invasive 
species treatments.

::: {.card title='Indian Ricegrass'}
Looking at low percentages of Indian Ricegrass cover in grasslands, it appears
that this native perennial grass has been outcompeted by invasive annual 
grasses.
